# Game Design
### Identifying a Need

Need: My game will be designed to improve hand-eye coordination, cognitive development,fine motor skills and multi-tasking abilities in children between the ages of 5-8. This game will involve a storyline and progression to keep the audience engaged as well as a straightforward goal. Additionally, the game will be simple enough to play without the help of a parent however the difficultly will increase as the advances. 

Problem statement: Children within the ages 5-8 are often energetic and need to be kept engaged throughout the day using various different ways. Through these years their hand-eye coordination, cognitive development, fine motor skills and multi-tasking ablitites also need to be developed in a proper way. My 2D platformer game will be simple, have a straighforward goal and intergrate a storyline to keep players occupied and entertained while also cultivating the skills listed above. 

Skill development: In order to develop the skills required to create this game in Unity, I will go through the video tutorials posted in google classroom.
